# Singleton Design Pattern with Global Config Object in PHP

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the Singleton design pattern in PHP, using a global configuration object as an example.

## Description

The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it. In this repository, we showcase the Singleton pattern by creating a global configuration object that can be accessed and modified from any part of the codebase.

The global configuration object holds various configuration settings that need to be accessed throughout the application. By using the Singleton pattern, we can ensure that only a single instance of the configuration object is created and shared across different components, preventing multiple conflicting instances and maintaining consistency.

## Features

- Singleton design pattern implementation in PHP.
- Global configuration object for storing and accessing application settings.
- Demonstrates how to enforce a single instance of an object throughout the codebase.
- Easy-to-understand code examples with detailed comments.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the Singleton design pattern with a global config object in your PHP project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-patterns/php/singleton/global-config-object.git
